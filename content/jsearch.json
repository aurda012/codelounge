Teams at more than 300,000 organizations, including 80% of the Fortune 100, rely on the Airtable Connected Apps Platform to connect their people and data and achieve their most important goals. Founded in 2013 and headquartered in San Francisco, Airtable ranks #6 on the Forbes Cloud 100 and has raised $1.36 billion to date.\n\nAirtable’s infrastructure is evolving to meet the needs of our fast growing engineering org. We are looking for backend engineers to join our team to help improve critical product infrastructure, with a focus on building systems that have a great developer experience and will scale as we grow.\n\nWe currently have openings on:\n• Storage: The Storage team’s mission is to accelerate product development at Airtable by providing scalable, reliable, and easy-to-use storage abstractions. We use RDS MySQL, DynamoDB, Redis, and TiDB. We’re looking for folks interested in distributed systems and databases who are excited to work on business-critical, petabyte-scale storage systems. You will own all aspects of building, running, and improving these systems, from the underlying infrastructure all the way to the developer-facing code abstractions.\n• Data Infrastructure: The Data Infrastructure team’s mission is to enable data-driven decision making at Airtable by providing reliable, self-service, high-performance analytics infrastructure. We use technologies like Redshift, Spark, Trino, Kinesis, and Flink to process vast quantities of data in our data warehouse. This infrastructure is used by Airtable’s data engineers and analysts, as well as product developers building features powered by business data.\n• Service Orchestration: Our service orchestration pod’s charter is to implement the next generation of technologies for building, running, and deploying backend services. We are looking for engineers who are excited about building our infrastructure to power Airtable’s product development in a reliable and scalable way. You are someone who asks yourself, “what can we build today that will enable our scale for 5 or 10 years in the future?” Your work will shape our service deployment and orchestration for years to come. The successful candidate will have experience and/or strong desire to learn about how to build and run scalable distributed systems, and Service Oriented Architecture (SOA).\n• This pod has adopted a Kubernetes (k8s) based technology stack for service deployment and orchestration. We completed our k8s migration in 2023 H1, and now we are bringing this k8s based service platform to the next level to empower engineers across the company to build, deploy, and run services. This effort is extremely important to manage the growing complexity of our backend architecture.\n\nPlease note: while we employ a hybrid working model at Airtable (flexible in working from the office or elsewhere), we are looking to hire candidates who are based in the San Francisco Bay Area who are open to coming into the office at least ~1-2 times/week for team collaboration.\n\nWhat you'll do\n• Proactively identify and lead significant improvements to Airtable’s infrastructure, working across teams and product areas to maximize business and engineering impact.\n• Work on systems-level problems in a complex design space where scalability, efficiency, reliability, and security really matter.\n• Build clean, reusable, and maintainable abstractions that will be used by Airtable’s engineers for years to come.\n• Take full ownership of components of Airtable’s infrastructure, including responsibility for reliability, performance, efficiency, and observability of our production environment.\n\nWho you are\n• You have 2+ years of industry experience, and are excited about learning new technologies and applying them in a fast-changing environment. Please note this is not a new grad position.\n• You have experience in areas such as databases, distributed systems, service-oriented architectures, and data infrastructure.\n• You derive joy from refactoring and building clean abstractions in order to make complex systems fun to develop on and easy to understand.\n• You have a strong background in computer science with a degree in CS or a related field.\n• You are currently based or willing to relocate to the San Francisco Bay Area.\n\nCompensation awarded to successful candidates will vary based on their work location, relevant skills and experience. The base salary range for this role is $148,100- $221,500 for work locations in San Francisco, Mountain View, Seattle, NYC and LA. Our total compensation package also includes the opportunity to receive benefits, restricted stock units, and may include incentive compensation.

The Software Engineer Intern will help us complete the migration from our legacy code base (written in jQuery) to the new codebase. The intern will be assigned existing functionality in the jQuery website that requires porting to the new codebase. This is not a copy and paste exercise, but an opportunity to understand the needs of the users, see how the existing code does and does not meet these needs, and then deploy into production the improved user experience in a modern cloud-based web framework.\n\nOver the past year, Wildcat has migrated our data system to Azure and has rewritten the majority of our codebase, maximizing the use of cloud IaaS resources and upgrading to modern tooling and approaches. The majority of our stack is now Azure SQL databases, .Net 8 API and a Remix/React.js website for the Scientists and Engineers.\n\nAbout Us:\n\nWildcat Discovery Technologies, based in San Diego, California, is a materials R&D company transitioning its focus from battery research and development to cathode material supply. Our commitment lies in the discovery and development of advanced materials for lithium-ion batteries.\n\nWe follow three strategic paths:\n• Collaborating on projects to enhance battery performance through material optimization.\n• Developing proprietary battery materials for next-generation electrodes and electrolytes.\n• Gearing up to launch a series of cathode active materials.\n\nWildcat collaborates with industry leaders around the world to develop promising new materials for rechargeable and primary battery technologies using our state-of-the-art high throughput platform (HTP) combinational chemistry. Our team of industry-leading scientists synthesize and test thousands of battery materials ten times faster than conventional research.\n\nWe use this proprietary technology for strategic collaborations, systematic scale-up, and to achieve world-class cathode material supply. We strive for innovation, excellence, and pushing the boundaries of battery technology.\n\nRequirements\n\nEssential Functions:\n• For a given functionality, understand its utility, pros and cons and then deliver said functionality into the new codebase.\n• Implement and maintain code storage and version control software.\n• Match and adhere to Wildcat’s coding philosophy.\n\nKnowledge, Skills & Abilities Required\n\nRequired:\n• Typescript\n• React\n• Git\n\nWe make use of the following tools and approaches and experience/awareness with them will be used to assess the suitability of the applicants:\n• React Router/Remix\n• Bootstrap\n• NodeJs\n• Docker\n• GitHub Actions\n• Azure\n\nEducation & Experience\n• Attained or working to attain a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science or equivalent levels of experience\n\nSchedule:\n• Part time: Minimum 5-10 hours per week, maximum of 29 hours per week\n• 3-4 months, with opportunity for extension\n• Hybrid work schedule\n\nPay: $20.00/hr",
